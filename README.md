Welcome to the Starstruck project! Starstruck is yet another game engine written in rust. It's goals are to offer a more user friendly experience rather than using **gfx-rs** directly, while still maintaining high performance.

The project is still in Alpha stage and Api changes will happen and occur frequently!
